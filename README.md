The code contains many mechanics which are:<br /><br />
1. Circle and rectangle collision detection, rectangle and rectangle collision and space partitioning algorithms (TODO) to reduce collision pairs<br /><br />
2. Advanced text rendering<br /><br />
3. Particles<br /><br />
4. Different levels<br /><br />
5. Postprocessing effects<br /><br />

6. Triangle strips draw which can render a rectangle with four vertices<br /><br />
7. Mini game engine which contains game loop, rendering, handling user input, audio...<br /><br />
8. Different powerups, more to be done<br /><br />
